# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. This binary Classification problem is one in which we need to predict our Target label which is “Loan Status”. That is, YES or NO loan approval.

It is important to perform some basic analysis to get an overall idea of the dataset. That is, there is a need to perform descriptive statistics on the data to get an overall as well as in-depth information about the dataset and the variables in it. 

We have to check some common assumptions about the data we are testing: Independence of observations – multicollinearity (to make sure that the variables are not related); Homogeneity of variance - the variance within each group being compared is similar among all groups; Normality of data - the data follows a normal distribution (applies to quantitative data only)
